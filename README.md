This project was made as a mid-term exam assignment for my Web Programming course.
It is a front-end web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to replicate the basic user interface and interaction of the popular short-video app TikTok.

### **TikTok Clone**

TikTok Clone aims to simulate TikTok’s visual experience including the video feed layout, navigation bar, and user profile pages.
This project focuses on UI/UX, responsive web design, and interactive front-end features without backend or database integration.

This project was created as part of my learning process, so there may still be some limitations or unfinished elements.
